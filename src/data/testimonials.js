Our team was engaged to deliver the network and Wi-Fi infrastructure for the first Cine\u00e9polis dine-in theater in the United States, located in San Diego, California. A key requirement was enabling staff and POS systems to reliably take and process orders over Wi-Fi inside and outside of the sound-insulated theaters. We were very concerned about potential "dead zones" created by the building's layout and soundproofing, as well as the need to cleanly separate business systems, POS, internal staff Wi-Fi, and guest Wi-Fi for both performance and security.

Grandin Consulting was brought in to design and implement a solution that addressed these challenges end-to-end. Matt Spidella took the time to understand our operational workflow, the theater environment, and Cine\u00e9polis' expectations, and then delivered:

A robust wireless design that maintained strong, reliable coverage throughout the theaters, lobbies, and service areas, even where soundproofing and construction could have caused issues.

A clear IP addressing and segmentation schema that isolated business infrastructure, POS systems, internal staff & guest Wi-Fi into dedicated network segments.

A secure, well-structured configuration that balanced performance, security, and ease of management, giving us and our client confidence in the long-term operation of the environment.

The result was a Wi-Fi and network infrastructure that worked as intended from day one. Staff were able to move in and out of theaters without losing connectivity, POS systems operated reliably over Wi-Fi, and we had proper separation between critical business systems and guest access.

Grandin Consulting delivered exactly what we needed: a thoughtful, well-engineered solution that solved a difficult problem in a complex environment. I would not hesitate to work with Grandin Consulting again, and I highly recommend them for any organization needing reliable, secure, and well-designed network solutions.

Sincerely,

    quote: `Matt and the team at Grandin Consulting quickly found what an entire team had been chasing for days.

We engaged the team to troubleshoot a persistent network performance issue that both our internal team and our vendor were struggling to pin down. He approached the problem methodically, walked everyone through his thought process, and ultimately traced the root cause to a routing configuration issue. By redesigning the routing metrics, they eliminated the bottleneck and restored the performance and stability we needed.

What stood out most was not just that they fixed the problem, but how clearly they communicated along the way - translating complex networking concepts into terms our non-technical stakeholders could understand. Because of that experience, we've since engaged them again to design a Wi-Fi deployment scheme for one of our hotels, and we're confident that the result will be just as robust and well thought out.

We consider Grandin Consulting a trusted partner for our network and infrastructure needs and would not hesitate to recommend them.`,
